Why is it important to choose a license?
The importance in obtaining and choosing between licenses is to establish the freedoms of a program for future users and developers. Without obtaining a license for your open source project, you fail to protect those freedoms for everyone involved.

Why not to use a project that doesn't have an axplicit license.
Any open-source project that doesn't have a license explicitly detailing the freedoms of the project, has the potential to be non-free. You as a developer, will be limited in what you are able to do with the project, in terms of distribution and modification.

"Why the Web beat Gopher" response:
Absolutely. Exposure is absolutely essential to any open source project, and its on the devs for failing to release their software early on. One of the reasons this is necessary is so outside developers can contribute alongside your project, fixing or adding things along the way. But most importantly, spreading word about the project. The requirement of licensing fees for host with a dotcom domain, understandably turned away users from Gopher. It's just common sense.

The MIT License distinguishes itself by being one of the more open of the policies. In summary, it states that developers can do waht they want with it (the project), as long as they list the original developer as soucre.

The best License "for the greater good", would have to be the GPL-3 license as it provides the most freedom with whatever future developers, users, and companies want to do; save for the fact they need to put forth any changes they have made to the software. By doing so they allow interested developers to look into the code and potentially contribute to the project, benefiting it. Allow users the freedom to revert to whatever build of the project that they desire, which is important if a "current" release is bugged or such. And yet it still allows the company to charge for the project. This license benefits all.
